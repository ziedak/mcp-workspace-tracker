# MCP Workspace-Tracker Phase 2 Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for Phase 2 features of the MCP workspace-tracker project, focusing on Class Hierarchy Analysis and Dependency Graph Analysis. The approach uses a generated sample workspace with various TypeScript constructs to validate the new functionality without modifying the existing codebase.

## Test Environment

A sample workspace has been created at `/tmp/mcp-sample-test/sample-workspace` with the following structure:

- Basic TypeScript project setup (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- Models and services implementing typical patterns
- Class hierarchy with inheritance relationships
- Interface implementation relationships
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Advanced TypeScript patterns (decorators, mixins)

## Testing Scripts

The following scripts have been created to support testing:

1. **create-sample-workspace-modified.sh**
   - Creates a baseline sample workspace with basic TypeScript constructs

2. **analyze-workspace.sh**
   - Performs basic analysis of the sample workspace structure
   - Lists files, interfaces, classes, and dependencies

3. **test-phase2-features.sh**
   - Enhances the sample workspace with complex class hierarchies
   - Adds decorator pattern implementations
   - Creates circular dependencies
   - Implements mixin patterns
   - Analyzes the resulting structures

4. **run-phase2-tests.sh**
   - Simulates how MCP workspace-tracker would analyze the workspace
   - Generates reports for class hierarchy and dependency analysis
   - Saves results to `/tmp/mcp-sample-test/results`

## Test Scenarios

### Class Hierarchy Analysis

The sample workspace provides test cases for:

1. **Basic Inheritance**
   - Simple class extension (e.g., `Employee extends Person`)

2. **Interface Implementation**
   - Classes implementing interfaces (e.g., `Person implements Auditable`)
   - Classes implementing multiple interfaces (e.g., `EmployeeDecorator implements Contactable, Auditable`)

3. **Abstract Classes**
   - Abstract base classes with concrete implementations (e.g., `BaseEntity`)
   - Abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses (e.g., `validate()`)

4. **Mixins**
   - Function-based mixins that extend class capabilities
   - Multiple mixin compositions

### Dependency Graph Analysis

The sample workspace provides test cases for:

1. **Simple Dependencies**
   - Direct imports between modules

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - ModuleA → ModuleB → ModuleA
   - ModuleC → ModuleE → ModuleC

3. **Complex Dependency Chains**
   - Multi-level dependencies across many files
   - Star pattern with a central module imported by many others

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. Run the setup scripts to create the test environment:
   ```bash
   bash /tmp/mcp-sample-test/create-sample-workspace-modified.sh
   bash /tmp/mcp-sample-test/test-phase2-features.sh
   ```

2. Develop the Phase 2 features using this sample workspace to validate functionality

3. Run the test script periodically to check progress:
   ```bash
   bash /tmp/mcp-sample-test/run-phase2-tests.sh
   ```

4. Check the test results in `/tmp/mcp-sample-test/results`

### For Testers

1. Use the provided scripts to verify that Phase 2 features work as expected

2. Compare the actual output from the MCP workspace-tracker with the expected output

3. Report any discrepancies or missing functionality

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Non-invasive Testing**
   - No modifications to the existing codebase are required
   - Tests can be run repeatedly without side effects

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases**
   - Covers a wide range of TypeScript patterns and constructs
   - Tests edge cases like circular dependencies and complex inheritance

3. **Clear Success Criteria**
   - Expected outputs are well-defined
   - Easy to verify if implementations are working correctly

4. **Reusable Test Environment**
   - Can be extended for future features
   - Provides consistent baseline for regression testing

## Next Steps

1. Integrate these test scripts into the CI/CD pipeline

2. Extend the sample workspace with additional test cases as needed

3. Create automated validation of test results against expected outcomes

4. Document specific edge cases and their expected handling

remember and memorize this

- if \*.ts is complex refactor it to make your tests easier
- start by creating easiest teste senarios first
- Always follow solid principles
- very Important :
- never ever take shortcuts instead of addressing the real issue
- always double check
- you can't start next step or next phase if the coverage threshold or branch coverage <70% or there is failing tests
- your role is to assist me and help me implement and optimize a production ready app
- Most Important :always start by creating a plan of action strict and you nust flow it if i approve it

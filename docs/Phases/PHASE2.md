# MCP Server for VSCode - Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Objectives

Phase 2 focuses on expanding the code intelligence capabilities by implementing advanced analysis features that build upon the core infrastructure established in Phase 1. The main goals are:

1. Implement class hierarchy analysis
2. Build a module dependency graph
3. Enhance the persistence layer for new data structures
4. Extend the MCP protocol for new query types

## Components to Implement

### 1. ClassHierarchyBuilder

The ClassHierarchyBuilder will analyze relationships between classes, interfaces, and types to build a comprehensive hierarchy map.

**Features:**

- Inheritance relationship tracking (class extends)
- Interface implementation detection (class implements)
- Mixin and composition pattern detection
- Type inheritance and extension mapping
- Method override analysis and virtual method tables

**Implementation Plan:**

- Create a new class in `src/core/ClassHierarchyBuilder.ts`
- Extend the TypeScript Compiler API integration to extract hierarchical relationships
- Implement algorithms to build and traverse the inheritance tree
- Add serialization support for the hierarchy data structures

### 2. ProjectGraphBuilder

The ProjectGraphBuilder will analyze import/export relationships between modules to create a dependency graph of the project.

**Features:**

- Import/export relationship mapping
- Circular dependency detection
- Unused module identification
- Dependency weight analysis
- External vs. internal dependency differentiation

**Implementation Plan:**

- Create a new class in `src/core/ProjectGraphBuilder.ts`
- Implement graph data structures for representing module relationships
- Add traversal and query algorithms for the dependency graph
- Integrate with the existing SymbolIndexer for import/export data

### 3. Enhanced Persistence Layer

Extend the existing PersistenceManager to support storing and retrieving the new data structures.

**Features:**

- Efficient storage format for hierarchical data
- Graph serialization and deserialization
- Incremental updates to avoid full recalculation
- Version compatibility for cache files

**Implementation Plan:**

- Extend `src/persistence/PersistenceManager.ts` with new methods
- Create specific serializers for class hierarchy and dependency graph
- Implement change detection for incremental updates
- Add cache versioning for the new data types

### 4. Extended MCP Protocol

Extend the MCPProtocolHandler to support queries against the new data structures.

**Features:**

- Class hierarchy queries (find subclasses, implementations)
- Dependency queries (what depends on X, what X depends on)
- Combined queries (e.g., find all subclasses that depend on module Y)
- Result formatting for various client needs

**Implementation Plan:**

- Extend `src/protocol/MCPProtocolHandler.ts` with new endpoints
- Implement query handlers for the new data structures
- Add response formatting for hierarchy and graph data
- Create documentation for the new protocol extensions

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**

   - Test ClassHierarchyBuilder with various inheritance patterns
   - Test ProjectGraphBuilder with different module structures
   - Test serialization and deserialization of new data types

2. **Integration Tests:**

   - Test interaction between SymbolIndexer, ClassHierarchyBuilder, and ProjectGraphBuilder
   - Test persistence and retrieval of the combined data structures
   - Test protocol handling for complex queries

3. **Performance Tests:**
   - Benchmark hierarchy building on large codebases
   - Measure memory usage for large dependency graphs
   - Test incremental update performance

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the MCP Server should be able to:

1. Build and maintain a complete class hierarchy for the workspace
2. Generate a comprehensive module dependency graph
3. Efficiently store and retrieve these structures
4. Answer complex queries about code relationships
5. Provide enhanced code intelligence data to VSCode and Copilot Agent Mode

## Timeline

1. ClassHierarchyBuilder implementation: 1-2 weeks
2. ProjectGraphBuilder implementation: 1-2 weeks
3. Enhanced Persistence Layer: 1 week
4. Extended MCP Protocol: 1 week
5. Testing and refinement: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 5-8 weeks depending on complexity and scope adjustments.

## Next Steps After Phase 2

1. Implement real-time updates via WebSockets (Phase 3)
2. Add intelligent code completion suggestions
3. Develop visualization capabilities for class hierarchies and dependency graphs
4. Implement code refactoring suggestions based on structural analysis

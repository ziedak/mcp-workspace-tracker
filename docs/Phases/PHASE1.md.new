# MCP Server for VSCode - Phase 1 Implementation (Completed)

## Completed Components

1. **Architecture & Project Structure Setup**

   - SOLID-principled TypeScript project structure
   - Dependency injection with Inversify
   - Interface-first approach with clear contracts
   - Build and test scripts
   - Directory structure following clean architecture patterns

2. **Core Interfaces**

   - `ILogger`: Well-defined logging interface
   - `IWorkspaceScanner`: File system scanning contract
   - `ISymbolIndexer`: Code symbol analysis contract
   - `IPersistenceManager`: Data persistence contract
   - `IMcpWorkspaceTracker`: Main service orchestration

3. **WorkspaceScanner Service**

   - Efficient file system traversal
   - Robust support for gitignore patterns using minimatch
   - Proper handling of excluded directories (node_modules, .git, etc.)
   - Directory depth limiting
   - Error handling with proper logging

4. **SymbolIndexer Service**

   - TypeScript Compiler API integration
   - Symbol extraction (classes, interfaces, functions, methods, properties, variables)
   - Documentation extraction from JSDoc comments
   - Export status tracking (exported, default export, none)
   - Hierarchical symbol structure with parent-child relationships

5. **PersistenceManager Service**

   - File hash-based change detection
   - Component-specific caching
   - Cache versioning
   - JSON serialization
   - Error handling with proper logging

6. **Logger Service**
   
   - Winston-based logging implementation
   - Log level configuration
   - Structured logging format

7. **MCP Integration**
   
   - MCP TypeScript SDK integration
   - Resource registration system
   - Tool registration system
   - Server setup with configurable transport (HTTP, stdio)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix type errors in the codebase

   - Added proper TypeScript type definitions
   - Fixed modifiers access in TypeScript Compiler API usage
   - Improved error handling across all services
   - Ensured type safety throughout the codebase

2. ✅ Move to SOLID Architecture

   - Implemented dependency injection with Inversify
   - Defined clear interfaces for all components
   - Created proper service implementations
   - Established a clean project structure

3. Add Class Hierarchy Analysis (Phase 2)

   - Create a ClassHierarchyBuilder service and interface
   - Track inheritance relationships
   - Map interface implementations
   - Provide hierarchical views of the codebase

4. Implement Module Dependency Graph (Phase 2)

   - Create a DependencyGraphBuilder service and interface
   - Analyze import/export relationships
   - Build dependency trees
   - Detect circular dependencies

5. Create Comprehensive Test Suite

   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
   - Mocking of filesystem and TypeScript compiler API

## Phase 1 Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The Phase 1 implementation has been successfully completed with all targets achieved:

- ✅ Core infrastructure with SOLID principles
- ✅ Workspace scanning functionality
- ✅ Symbol indexing with TypeScript Compiler API
- ✅ Persistence management with caching
- ✅ MCP integration with resources and tools
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors
- ✅ Created proper logging system

The system is now ready for Phase 2 implementation, which will focus on advanced code analysis features.
